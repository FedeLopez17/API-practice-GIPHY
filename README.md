# API Practice Project :handshake:
###  [Check out the live demo](https://fedelopez17.github.io/API-practice-GIPHY/)!

## Description:
This simple project is an [assignment for The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-working-with-apis), and its my first time working with asynchronus JavaScript and APIs. :grin: <br>
It allows the user to search for gifs.

## Video Demonstration:

### Note:
I'm aware that API Keys should be secured somehow (I don't know how that works yet). However, this is just a very simple practice project using a free API, so I figured it'd be okay to have the key here in github this time.
